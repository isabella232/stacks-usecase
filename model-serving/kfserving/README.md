# DLRS + KFServing

KFServing provides a Kubernetes CRD for serving machine learning models on any framework - ([KFServing README.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving#kfserving)). KFServing is installed by default as part of Kubeflow, having Kubeflow running in a Kubernetes cluster and few extra configurations should be enough to serve your models with KFServing.

## Examples

In this directory you will find a list of examples integrating DLRS and KFServing.
